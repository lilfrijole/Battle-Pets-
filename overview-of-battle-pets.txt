This is an explanation of our game.
Welcome to Battle Pets! Your Privacy-Powered Virtual Pet Battle Begins Here

As a new trainer in the ZK Pets universe, you’re starting your journey with 3 unique NFTs! These NFTs represent your loyal companions, ready to join you in battles, quests, and beyond.
Introducing Your New Friends. The Objective of the game is to join a battle and see the results. A facilitator will prove that one nft is stronger than the other in a certain attribute: strength, speed, and stamina.

Players will join a table and click play. The rest is up to the gods.
